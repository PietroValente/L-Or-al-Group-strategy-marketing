## Overview
Throughout the Strategy and Marketing course, I gained valuable knowledge and insights into the various concepts, theories, methodologies, and tools that support the strategic and marketing decision-making processes of organizations. With a focus on sustainable growth and the ongoing digital transformation, I learned how to interpret the current competitive and marketing environment and its impact on business performance, as well as how to launch a new business and develop effective marketing strategies.

Using this knowledge and skill set, I was able to complete a project on L'Oreal Group, a leading cosmetics and beauty company. The project involved analyzing L'Oreal's strategic and marketing processes, as well as assessing the effectiveness of its value generation mechanisms. Through the use of relevant theories and models, I evaluated L'Oreal's business unit and corporate portfolio strategies, competitive forces, and SWOT analysis. I also examined L'Oreal's marketing mix, customer experience, and branding strategies, as well as its approach to digital disruption and strategic innovation.

Overall, the project allowed me to apply the theoretical concepts and practical tools learned in the course to a real-world business case, providing me with valuable experience and insight into the strategic and marketing decision-making processes of a leading global organization.
